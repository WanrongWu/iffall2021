      <h1>Floated Elements</h1>

      <section>

        <p><img class="portrait" src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="portrait placeholder">There is an <code class="tag">img</code> element at the beginning of this paragraph of text. Because <code class="tag">img</code> tags are <em>inline</em> elements by default, it is making the first line of the paragraph very tall. However, css provides a way to make text flow around the image. We do this with the <dfn>float</dfn> property.</p>

        <p>The <code>float</code> property is applied to the element around which we want text to wrap. It may seem a bit counter-intutive, but in your HTML code, the floated element must come <em>before</em> the text that wraps around it, just like this document. We can <code>float: left;</code> or <code>float: right;</code>, but sadly, we cannot <code>float: center;</code></p>

        <p>We can use <code>margin</code> on the floated element to control white-space around it, "pushing away" the text that gets too close.</p>

        <ol class="instructions">
          <li>Create a stylesheet and link it to this document.</li>
          <li>Select the <code>portrait</code> class, and add the rule <code>float: left;</code></li>
          <li>Set a <code>margin</code> value for the portrait such that it has <code>2rem</code> breathing-room to the right and bottom, but <code>0</code> top and left.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><!-- Put the copied <img> tag here -->Let's duplicate the <code class="tag">img</code> tag above, and place a copy of it at the beginning of this paragraph.</p>

        <ol class="instructions">
          <li>Copy the <code class="tag">img</code> tag as indicated. No need to style &mdash; it will pick up the same styles as the first <code class="tag">img</code> because it has the same class applied.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>See how the Instructions block also floated around the image? Floating an element doesn't only make text wrap... it makes <em>everything</em> that follows the element wrap, until the element is no longer in the way. But what if we don't want that? What if we want to make sure the instructions always 'get past' the floated item, no matter what?</p>

        <ol class="instructions">
          <li>Make a selector for <code>.instructions</code>, and add the rule <code>clear: both;</code></li>
        </ol>

        <p>We use the <code>clear</code> property to tell a subsequent element to 'clear' floated items. You can <code>clear: left;</code> to clear any elements that are floated left, <code>clear: right;</code> to clear any elements that are floated right, or <code>clear: both;</code> to clear all floated items regardless of the side they're on.</p>
