    <h1>Building Grids</h1>

    <p>There are a number of ways to build grids with HTML and css. Let's look at a few of the most common.</p>

    <p>We're going to build four grids, each very visually similar, but using different techniques. However, many of the styles will be <em>shared across all four grids</em>, and therefore each grid will have <strong>two</strong> classes: one that they all share (<code>grid</code>) and one that is specific to the technique (<code>using-floats</code>, <code>using-inline-block</code>, <code>using-flex</code>, or <code>using-grid</code> ). Pay attention to the instructions, because some rules will be applied using the shared class, and some with the specific class!</p>

    <section>

      <h1>Grids using the <code class="tag">table</code> element</h1>

      <p>Stop right there! <em>Don't do it.</em> While the <code class="tag">table</code> element does indeed produce a grid of cells, its semantic purpose is actually to present data that is tabular, like a spreadsheet of numbers. It is <strong>not</strong> intended to be used as a layout tool for page content. It also handles <dfn>responsiveness</dfn> (the ability of the page to adjust to the width of the window on any device) poorly. So, we're skipping it!</p>

      <h1>Grids using <em>float</em></h1>

      <p>It is possible to use the <em>float</em> property to create grids, and it is perhaps the oldest technique for doing so. <em>We'll take a look at how it's done, but be advised that personally I find other grid techniques to be friendlier, and I only use <code>float</code> when I actually need to wrap text around an element.</em></p>

      <p>Note that in this example and with others following, we'll use a <code class="tag">ul</code> element to represent the grid, and <code class="tag">li</code> elements for each cell in the grid. This is because in most cases, a grid is conceptually a list that we're just 'presenting' in rows/columns because it's an effective way to communicate small multiples of a thing &mdash; like portraits in a yearbook. Semantically, those portraits are just an alphabetical list.</p>

      <p>I've started a list below, with a single item. Let's begin by populating the HTML of our list. <em>Don't be alarmed: The pictures are going to be huge. We'll take care of that in a minute when we add css.</em></p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Replicate the <code class="tag">li</code> element below to make a new <code class="tag">li</code> for eight people. You should end up with a single <code class="tag">ul</code> containing eight list items, each item with a photo and name.</li>
      </ol>

          <li>

            <div>Starlight Glimmer</div>
          </li>
        <!-- Add copies of the <li> element here, and change the names. (We can use the generic portait image for everybody.) -->
      </ul>

      <p>Okay, let's get these images under control so we can see what we're doing.</p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Create a stylesheet for this exercise, and link it in the document head.</li>
        <li>Add a css ruleset that selects <code class="tag">img</code> elements inside <code>.grid</code>. This is the shared class, so this rule will apply to <strong>all</strong> of the grids we build.</li>
        <li>In the selector, add this rule: <code>width: 150px;</code></li>
      </ol>

      <p>The images are now small, but the list-items are still displaying as a bulleted list. Let's override the default list styles.</p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Create a ruleset for the <code>.grid</code> class, and add the rule <code>padding: 0;</code>. This should remove default padding on the <code class="tag">ul</code> that wraps our grid.</li>
        <li>Create a new ruleset to select the <code class="tag">li</code> elements within <code>.grid</code>. Add the rule <code>display: block;</code>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Bullets are gone, padding is gone, but our images are still not aligning side-by-side. This is where <code>float</code> comes in.</p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Add a new selector for this specific grid's <code class="tag">li</code>. Use <code>.using-floats li</code>. We're using the specific class because this rule applies <strong>only</strong> to this grid.
          Set <code>float: left;</code>. <strong>WARNING: This is going to make the page look very broken. It's okay, keep going... but this is why I don't like using floats!</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p>Our elements are now side-by-side, but $#!% went sideways. Remember why? <em>Everything</em> following a floated element tries to wrap around it. That's good, it's what's making our items go side-by-side... but we need to <em>clear</em> the floated elements at the end of the grid. There is a clever technique we can use to do this. We'll use the <code>::after</code> <em>pseudo-element</em> to insert an element at the end of the list, and apply our <code>clear: both;</code> rule to it.</p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Create a ruleset with the selector <code>.using-floats::after</code>.</li>
        <li>Add the rule <code>content: "";</code> so the pseudo-element exists.</li>
        <li>Add the rule <code>display: block;</code>. This makes pseudo-element the width of its container, even though we cannot see it.</li>
        <li>Add the rule <code>clear: both;</code>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>At this point, our grid starts to look like it makes sense. But lets take a few more steps to tidy things up. We'll apply these rules using the shared <code>grid</code> class, so we don't have to do them again for the next grid.</p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Create a selector for <code>.grid li</code> and set the following rules:</li>
        <li><code>width: 25%;</code> Ensures our grid is "4-up" (25% * 4 = 100% of the available width).</li>
        <li><code>text-align: center;</code> Centers the image and name within each box.</li>
        <li><code>font-size: 0.8rem;</code> Makes the text a bit smaller.</li>
        <li><code>margin-bottom: 1rem;</code> Adds some space below each item.</li>
        <li>Finally, in your selector for the <code class="tag">img</code>, change the width to <code>width: 90%;</code>. This means "be 90% the width of your parent." The parent <code>li</code> is 25% of the total page width. This ensures the image has a bit of space on either side within its parent item, even on small devices.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We have a serviceable grid! But oh, <em>so</em> many steps to get here. There must be a better way, right?</p>

    <section>

      <h1>Grids using <em>inline-block</em></h1>

      <p>We've discussed how some elements are <em>inline</em> elements and some are <em>block</em> elements.You may have figured out by now that we can control this behavior with the <code>display</code> css property. Even though a <code class="tag">code</code> element (for instance) is normally <em>inline</em>, we can force it to be a <em>block</em> element with css like this: <code>code { display: block; }</code>.</p>

      <p>There exists a 'hybrid' of these two behaviors: <code>display: inline-block;</code>. Elements with this rule applied will be styleable like blocks (all of the padding, margin, etc), but will <strong>not</strong> expand automatically to fill the width of their parent. Instead, they will only be wide enough to hold their content, and more importantly, they will align themselves horizontally like words, fitting themselves left-to-right until wrapping to a new line. We can use this behavior to make a grid!</p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Copy the entire <code class="tag">ul</code> grid from the previous section, and paste it here, then change it's class list to be <code>class="grid using-inline-block"</code>. Note the space, it means there are <em>two</em> classes on this element.</li>
      </ol>
      <ul class="grid using-inline-block">
        <li>
          <img src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="Abram Siemsen portrait">

          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="Abram Siemsen portrait">

          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="Abram Siemsen portrait">
            <div>Gizmo</div>
          </li>
        <!-- Add copies of the <li> element here, and change the names. (We can use the generic portait image for everybody.) -->
      </ul>

      <!-- <ul class="grid using-inline-block">...</ul> goes here -->

      <p>Look, we picked up a bunch of existing styles from the shared <code>grid</code> class, so our images are already sized, the text is centered, etc. Hurray for shared classes to avoid repetition!</p>

      <p>Let's start out like we did for <em>floats</em>, except this time, the <code class="tag">li</code> element will be <code>display: inline-block;</code>. Don't forget, we're styling a new grid now, with a different specific class name, so you'll make a new set of selectors to control styles specific to this grid, prefixed with <code>.using-inline-block</code>!</p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>For this grid's <code class="tag">li</code> elements, set <code>display: inline-block;</code>. Be sure you aren't styling using the shared <code>.grid li</code> selector! Instead, what we're doing here is <em>overriding</em> the existing rule with a new one.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>This grid is shaping up fairly quickly, but there's one quirk. Our shared styles say the <code class="tag">li</code> elements should be <code>width: 25%;</code>... so why aren't they 4-up? The answer lies with a rendering detail of <code>inline-block</code> elements. Because <em>inline-block</em> elements wrap like words, it turns out the browser pays attention to the <kbd>space</kbd> character between these elements in the HTML code &mdash; just like it pays attention to a <kdb>space</kdb> between words. What's happening is this: we have 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% for our list items <strong>+ 3 spaces</strong>, which adds up to more than 100%. The last item must therefore fall to the next line.</p>
      
      <p>The solution is some creative css!</p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Create a selector for <code>.using-inline-block</code>, and set <code>font-size: 0;</code>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We've shrunk the space <em>between</em> the <code class="tag">li</code> elements to nothing, so we're back to a perfect 25% &times; 4. <strong>However: if we hadn't explicitly set a font-size for the <code class="tag">li</code> elements earlier (remember <code>font-size: 0.8rem;</code>?), our names would have disappeared too, because they'd have inherited <code>font-size: 0;</code> from the surrounding <code class="tag">ul</code>.</strong> Try using the inspector to 'un-check' the <code>font-size</code> style rule for <code>.grid li</code> and see for yourself.</p>

      <h1>Grids using <code>flex</code></h1>

      <p><dfn>Flex Layout</dfn>, or <dfn>flexbox</dfn>, is a very powerful collection of layout tools in css.This lesson will not even attempt to get into all the intricacies of flex layout, but we can at least scratch the surface by seeing how it can be used for simple grids like ours. If you want to dig deeper, the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Complete Guide to Flexbox</a> is a fantastic resource.</p>

      <p>To demonstrate, let's copy our grid <code class="tag">ul</code> once again.</p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Copy the entire <code class="tag">ul</code> grid from the previous section, and paste it here, then change its class list to be <code>class="grid using-flex"</code>.</li>
      </ol>
      <ul class="grid using-flex">
        <li>
          <img src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="Abram Siemsen portrait">
          <div>Batman</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <img src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="Abram Siemsen portrait">
            <div>Robin</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="Abram Siemsen portrait">
            <div>Raven</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="Abram Siemsen portrait">
            <div>Starfire</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="Abram Siemsen portrait">
            <div>Beast Boy</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="Abram Siemsen portrait">
            <div>Cyborg</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="Abram Siemsen portrait">
            <div>Blackfire</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="http://wudesign.me/resources/basic-layout/images/portrait.png" alt="Abram Siemsen portrait">
            <div>Gizmo</div>
          </li>
        <!-- Add copies of the <li> element here, and change the names. (We can use the generic portait image for everybody.) -->
      </ul>

      <!-- <ul class="grid using-flex">...</ul> goes here -->

      <p>Again, our shared styles are already applied, because this <code class="tag">ul</code> has the shared <code>grid</code> class. So all we need to do are add the few specific rules for this technique.</p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Create a selector for this grid's specific class. Add the following rules:</li>
        <li><code>display: flex;</code></li>
        <li><code>flex-wrap: wrap;</code></li>
      </ol>

      <p>A nice tidy grid once again! In previous methods, the critical rules for making the grid were appled to the child elements, the <code class="tag">li</code>s. This time, we're applying a rule to the parent element, the <code class="tag">ul</code>. Flex layout can feel a little strange at first because we control children indirectly through rules applied to the parent container, but when you're used to it, it's a very convenient and, uh, flexible (sorry) system. <em>(It's also the approach I normally use for grids myself.)</em></p>

      <h1>Grids using <em>grid</em></h1>

      <p>As with Flex layout, <em>Grid layout</em> is a very involved suite of tools, and we'll just use the most basic example here. For a complete reference, use the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">Complete Guide to Grid</a>.</p>

      <p>Let's copy our grid <code class="tag">ul</code> a final time.</p>

      
        <li>Copy the entire <code class="tag">ul</code> grid from the previous section, and paste it here, then change its class list to be <code>class="grid using-grid"</code>.</li>
      </ol>

          <li>

          <li>

            <div>Gizmo</div>
          </li>
        <!-- Add copies of the <li> element here, and change the names. (We can use the generic portait image for everybody.) -->
      </ul>
      
      <!-- <ul class="grid using-grid">...</ul> goes here -->
      

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Create a selector for this grid's <code class="tag">ul</code> using it's specific class, and add the following rules:</li>
        <li><code>display: grid;</code></li>
        <li><code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;</code></li>
      </ol>

      <p>The <dfn>fr</dfn> unit stands for <em>fraction</em>, so the above rule is instructing our grid to have four columns, each with an equal fraction of the available space.</p>

      <p>You'll see that our images got tiny. Oops! In this case, our shared rule setting the <code class="tag">li</code> elements to be <code>width: 25%;</code> is working against us. Since the grid column rule defines a conceptual parent 'column' in which each <code class="tag">li</code> resides, we can tell each <code class="tag">li</code> to be 100% of it's parent. We only want to do this for <em>this</em> grid, so we will not modify the shared rule. Instead, we will override it.</p>

      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Create a selector for <code>.using-grid li</code>, and set <code>width: 100%;</code>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We are now back to having the images fill their column correctly, and our grid is complete!</p>

    </section>

    <p>That's the end of our grid examples <em>(finally!)</em>, but it's worth noting that an extremely important part of this whole lesson has been the application of a shared class, in the <code>grid</code> class. Doing so helped avoid repititious work, it also helped avoid repetitous stylesheet code. If you find yourself copying entire blocks of css code then only changing the selector and one tiny detail in the ruleset, <em>you're doing it wrong.</em> This is a prime use-case for a shared class!</p>
