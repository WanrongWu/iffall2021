                        <p class="text">Archduchess Mathilda of Austria, daughter of Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen, set her dress on fire while trying to hide a cigarette from her father, who had forbidden her to smoke.</p>

                        <p class="text">An assassin stabbed Elizabeth with a thin file, which pierced her pericardium and a lung. Because her extremely tight corset held the wound closed, she did not realize what had happened (believing a passerby had struck her) and walked on for some time before collapsing.</p>

                        <p class="text">Thornton Jones, a lawyer in Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales, woke up to find that he had his throat slit. Motioning for a paper and pencil, he wrote, "I dreamt that I had done it. I awoke to find it true," and died 80 minutes later. He had done it himself while unconscious.[139] An inquest at Bangor delivered a verdict of "suicide while temporarily insane".</p>

                        <p class="text">The body of Mary Reeser, a 67-year-old woman from St. Petersburg, Florida, was found by the police almost totally cremated where she sat, while the apartment was relatively damage-free. Some speculate she spontaneously combusted.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p class="text">Gareth Jones, an actor, died of a heart attack between scenes of a live television play, Underground on the ITV network in the UK. Other members of the cast improvised lines, such as "I'm sure if So‑and‑so were here he would say..." to compensate for his absence. Coincidentally, his character was supposed to die of a heart attack in a later scene of the play.</p>
