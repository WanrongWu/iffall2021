                Hello World
                <p>1.My name is Flora Wu. I am a junior majoring in Communication Design.</p>
                <p>2.I take this course because I think I need some knowledge in coding.</p>
                <p>3.I don't have any experience in HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
                <p>4.I want to leanr to use HTML and learn what interaction design's basic concepts.</p>
                <p>5.I think digital medias or 3D effects can be examples that are different from paper designs.</p>

                <p>I like this one a lot because it is very compelling by showing their video works on the home page and it has good interactions too.</p>
